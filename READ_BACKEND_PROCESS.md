The GetTRX integration is successfully:

Initializing with your public key: pk_rW2wp1rnulRnx7oJQN8V_L-qEplUMSdm-eBQ1R24BkmW51f7ETcmpN0aUAN66dOm
Creating a payment token: pt_6827f5d7b88fd67057005285

The Canvas2D warning is unrelated to your payment integration - it's just a standard browser optimization warning about image processing and can be safely ignored.
Next Steps for Payment Processing
Now that the payment element is initializing correctly and generating tokens, you'll need to:

Process the payment token on your server:
javascript// In your server code
const paymentResult = await gettrxApi.createPayment(
  amount * 100, // Convert to cents
  paymentToken,
  saveCardForFutureUse
);

Handle the payment result:

Check for success/failure
Store transaction details in your database
Send confirmation emails if needed


Consider implementing error recovery:

Handle payment declines
Allow users to try a different payment method
Provide clear error messages


Add receipt generation:

Create PDF receipts
Send them via email
Store them for future reference



Production Considerations
When moving to production, remember to:

Switch to production API keys and URLs:

Change the SDK URL from https://js-dev.gettrx.com/sdk/js/payments/v1.0/sdk.js to the production URL
Use production API keys instead of test keys


Add proper error handling:

Implement retry logic
Log errors to your monitoring system
Provide user-friendly error messages


Implement proper security measures:

Never expose your secret key in client-side code
Secure your API endpoints
Use HTTPS for all communications


Add analytics and monitoring:

Track payment success/failure rates
Monitor for suspicious activity
Set up alerts for critical errors
